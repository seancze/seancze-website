                Sean realised that the world was looking abit too dull. He thus
                felt obligated to give it a tinge of magic.

                <br />
                When Sean is not busy trying to change the world, you can find
                him at highly-rated food establishments ðŸ˜‹, running or playing
                various racquet games with friends ðŸ¤—, earnestly (but often
                awkwardly) asking others about their own plans in life as he
                figures out his own ðŸ¤”, chilling with a good book or movie ðŸ¤“,
                or of course, hanging out with loved ones ðŸ¥°.
