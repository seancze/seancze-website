## Description
This repository was [originally written in AngularJS](https://github.com/seancze/seancze-website-angular) before the release of ChatGPT. 

For ease of maintainability, the codebase has been rewritten in NextJS with the help of ChatGPT.

I do not consider frontend to be my strong suit and so it was especially difficult for me to create a website design from scratch.

To help others aspiring to create their own basic portfolio site that is uniquely theirs, I would highly recommend the following sites:
1. https://www.noupe.com/design/web-developer-portfolio-examples.html
2. https://freefrontend.com/

## Credits
This website would not have been possible without the wealth of open source CSS templates, and JS packages available. As such, a best effort attempt has been made to add credits at the relevant lines of code.
